### Data scraping Mars news articles and weather data

This repository contains 2 Jupyter notebooks and one CSV file.

The first Jupyter notebook, [part_1_mars_news](https://github.com/jonesmer/mars-challenge/blob/main/part_1_mars_news.ipynb), scrapes article titles and previews from a website containing Mars news.

The second notebook, [part_2_mars_weather](https://github.com/jonesmer/mars-challenge/blob/main/part_2_mars_weather.ipynb), scrapes data from a table containing weather data from the Curiosity Rover on Mars, and does some analysis of the data. The CSV, [results.csv](https://github.com/jonesmer/mars-challenge/blob/main/results.csv), is an output from this notebook.

All code was written by me, with a little bit of help from my Google (for syntax).
